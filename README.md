# Dynamic Form Builder

This project is a dynamic form builder application built using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI (MUI). It allows users to create customizable forms with various fields and validations, preview the forms, and save them for later use.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Creation**: Users can create forms with customizable fields and set validation rules for each field.
- **Form Preview**: Users can preview how the form will look and behave for end users before saving it.
- **Saved Forms List**: Users can view a list of previously saved forms and select them to edit or preview.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: All form configurations are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing users to retrieve their forms without a backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>

3. Install the dependencies:

### Running the Application

```

This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
